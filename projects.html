        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Human Following Robot:</strong> Developed a sophisticated human-following capability for a holonomic robot equipped with an RGB-D camera. Leveraged advanced machine learning models such as YOLO-v7 for object detection, SuperPoint for feature extraction, and a PID controller for precise movement. This project demonstrated my ability to integrate computer vision and control systems, resulting in a robot that can effectively follow a human in real-time environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Quote Classification and Interpretation</strong> Fine-tuned state-of-the-art Transformer models like BERT, GPT-2, and T5 for multi-label classification of quotes. Explored various prompting techniques on T5 and Gemma models to enhance the quote interpretation task. Conducted extensive analysis of the results, improving the accuracy and efficiency of the models. This project showcased my expertise in natural language processing and machine learning.</li>
            <li><strong>Stock Exchange Application</strong> Prototyped a comprehensive stock trading application in Python to experiment with distributed systems concepts such as multithreading and leader elections. This application simulated a realistic trading environment, allowing me to test and implement various algorithms for fault tolerance and system optimization. The project highlighted my skills in software development and system design.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimizing Machine Learning Models for Predictive Analysis</strong> Developed and implemented custom machine learning models including Neural Networks, Random Forests, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for complex data analysis tasks. Employed hyper-parameter tuning and optimization techniques to maximize model performance, producing F1 Score graphs for data-driven decision making. This project demonstrated my proficiency in machine learning and data science.
