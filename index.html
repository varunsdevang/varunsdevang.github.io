        <p>
            Hello! I'm Varun Tarikere Shankarappa, a dedicated and passionate computer science student currently pursuing my Master's degree at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. With a perfect GPA of 4.00, I've engaged deeply in coursework covering Distributed Systems, Software Engineering, Reinforcement Learning, Internet Security, Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Robotics. My academic journey is built upon a solid foundation from my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at PES University, Bengaluru, where I first cultivated my technical skills and curiosity in fields like Data Structures, Computer Networks, and Cloud Computing.
            
            Professionally, I have amassed over two years of experience as a Software Development Engineer at Eagleview in Bengaluru, where I developed and maintained robust software services, particularly focusing on scalable Go Rest and GRPC microservices. My work there significantly improved system performance, reduced latency, and optimized costs, showcasing my ability to deliver efficient and scalable solutions. One of my notable achievements was pioneering a serverless service orchestrator with AWS Step Functions and Lambda, which led to a remarkable 60% reduction in cycle time.
            
            Beyond my professional experience, I have undertaken various projects that demonstrate my versatility and innovative spirit. These include developing a human-following robot, fine-tuning Transformer models for quote classification and interpretation, and prototyping a stock trading application to explore distributed systems concepts. My skills extend across multiple programming languages and technologies, including Golang, Python, AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes, and I am well-versed in methodologies such as Agile, serverless design, and microservices architecture.
            
            I am driven by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and excellence in the field of computer science, always eager to tackle new challenges and contribute to cutting-edge technological advancements. If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential opportunities, feel free to reach out to me at varundevang@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn.
            
            Looking forward to connecting with like-minded professionals and contributing to impactful projects!</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Human Following Robot:</strong> Developed a sophisticated human-following capability for a holonomic robot equipped with an RGB-D camera. Leveraged advanced machine learning models such as YOLO-v7 for object detection, SuperPoint for feature extraction, and a PID controller for precise movement. This project demonstrated my ability to integrate computer vision and control systems, resulting in a robot that can effectively follow a human in real-time environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Quote Classification and Interpretation</strong> Fine-tuned state-of-the-art Transformer models like BERT, GPT-2, and T5 for multi-label classification of quotes. Explored various prompting techniques on T5 and Gemma models to enhance the quote interpretation task. Conducted extensive analysis of the results, improving the accuracy and efficiency of the models. This project showcased my expertise in natural language processing and machine learning.</li>
            <li><strong>Stock Exchange Application</strong> Prototyped a comprehensive stock trading application in Python to experiment with distributed systems concepts such as multithreading and leader elections. This application simulated a realistic trading environment, allowing me to test and implement various algorithms for fault tolerance and system optimization. The project highlighted my skills in software development and system design.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimizing Machine Learning Models for Predictive Analysis</strong> Developed and implemented custom machine learning models including Neural Networks, Random Forests, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for complex data analysis tasks. Employed hyper-parameter tuning and optimization techniques to maximize model performance, producing F1 Score graphs for data-driven decision making. This project demonstrated my proficiency in machine learning and data science.
