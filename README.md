## Experience

### Eagleview, Bengaluru, India

#### Software Development Engineer
- **Duration:** Aug 2020 - Dec 2022
- Developed, designed, and maintained Assess services, an online drone imagery tool for property assessment.
- Implemented scalable Go Rest and GRPC microservices for handling geospatial data, images, and large binary data with authentication and access control.
- Achieved a 50% reduction in latency by implementing GRPC stream APIs for large binary data transfers, conducted load testing, identified critical bugs, and performed fixes.
- Integrated AWS Batch processes, reducing container load by 15% and significantly cutting AWS costs. Acquired proficiency in C# and delivered critical release APIs within a week.
- Designed and modeled an event-based internal notification platform utilizing AWS SNS and SQS, capable of handling over 1000 requests concurrently.
- Pioneered a serverless service orchestrator, replacing outdated technology with AWS Step Functions and Lambda, resulting in a 60% cycle time reduction.
- Translated critical code from MATLAB to Python, increasing scalability and reducing latency by more than 60%.
- Orchestrated cross-functional teams to establish standard interface models and proposed OpenTelemetry integration for serverless architecture tracing.

#### Software Development Engineer Intern
- **Duration:** Jan 2020 – July 2020
- Programmed scalable Go microservices, improved API documentation for resource onboarding, and proposed ELK stack integration for enhanced system tracing.
- Initiated a side project to prototype a Deployment Dashboard, leveraging Jenkins, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AWS S3 to monitor multi-environment deployments.

## Projects

### Human Following Robot
- Developed a human-following capability for a holonomic robot equipped with an RGB-D camera using YOLO-v7, SuperPoint, and a PID controller.

### Quote Classification and Interpretation
- Fine-tuned Transformer models like BERT, GPT-2, and T5 for multi-label classification of quotes. Experimented with various prompting techniques on T5 and Gemma models for the quote interpretation task and analyzed the results.

### Stock Exchange Application
- Prototyped a simple stock trading application in Python to test distributed systems concepts like multithreading and leader elections.

### Optimizing Machine Learning Models for Predictive Analysis
- Developed and implemented custom machine learning models—Neural Networks, Random Forests, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)—for complex data analysis tasks.
- Leveraged hyper-parameter tuning and optimization techniques to maximize model performance, creating F1 Score graphs for data-driven decisions.
